# Bayesian Data Science

Welcome to my repository on **Bayesian Data Science**. This is a collection of study notes and practical examples developed as part of my MSc Dissertation at the University of St Andrews.

The content is written in **Julia** and presented as a series of Jupyter Notebooks. These notebooks explore key topics in Bayesian inference, probabilistic modeling, and related computational techniques.

## Contents

- ðŸ“˜ Introductory notes on Bayesian statistics
- ðŸ§® Examples of Bayesian models implemented in Julia : Bayesian Logistic Regression, Fixed Basis Expansion
- ðŸ“Š Visualizations and inference techniques using probabilistic programming : Variational Inference, Gibbs Sampling

## Requirements

To run the notebooks, youâ€™ll need:
- Julia (>= 1.9)
- Jupyter (via `IJulia.jl`)
- Additional Julia packages listed in each notebook
